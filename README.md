# US-Covid-Analysis
This project is related to US Covid data which is fetched from Kaggle and it is updated real time with the latest stats. The dataset contains 6 columns which have details concerned about the Date, State, County, Fips, Cases and Deaths.

Using the columns in the data, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis to find out the top 5 states and counties with cases and deaths. Similarly, I also have plotted the timeseries graph since the beginning of the pandemic which will be updated when we pull the data always and make this script automated.
